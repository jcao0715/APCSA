I thought this assignment would be easier and take less time
Took me a while to format it correctly
Took a lot of trials
Kept forgetting which print statement to use and when to use it

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
In the future: I'll keep practicing until I fully understand when to use each print statement. I need to pay closer attention to 
avoid typos like spelling commands incorrectly or forgetting semicolons. I think it would be more helpful if I looked at the samples
and lessons more carefully.
