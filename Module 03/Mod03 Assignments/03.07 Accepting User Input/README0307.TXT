Overall easy to understand
Had to remember when to use .next() and .nextLine()
Needed to run several times in order to ensure accuracy

In the future: I need more practice with deciding which Scanner method is appropriate 
               and making sure the program works the way I want it to. I think it would 
               help if I played more with the program and looked back to the lecture notes
               to get a better idea of how the Scanner methods work.
