Challenging
Took time to think about how to write code so that it results in the way I want
Had to look back at previous lessons

***********************************************************************
In the future: I will keep practicing how to use everything that I've learned
               so far so that I don't forget anything. I will do this by looking
               back at previous lessons and using IMACS more often.
