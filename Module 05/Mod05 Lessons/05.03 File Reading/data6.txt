\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. \
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. \
We are met on a great battlefield of that war. \
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. \
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. \
But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. \
The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. \
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. \
It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. \
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.\
