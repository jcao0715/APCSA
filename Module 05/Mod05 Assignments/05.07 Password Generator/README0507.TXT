***************************** P M R ****************************
Took a while
Made a flow chart
Took me a long time to figure out how to generate different types together (i.e. numbers and letters)

In the future: I will practice more on how to efficiently use while loops and for loops in 	       my code and try to get more comfortable at reading and writing text files.
